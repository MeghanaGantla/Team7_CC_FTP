		<h2> Abstract </h2>
		<p>This project focuses on understanding the parameters affecting an accident's severity and other constraints like visibility at the time of the incident and the total affected time by the incident. The reason behind selecting this particular dataset is mainly its usability and detailed columns. Many thousands of accidents happen each day across the world and they vary in severity and reason. In this analysis, we understand the constraints that affect these incidents and also find out the hotspots. </p>
		<h2> Description of Dataset </h2>
		<p>The dataset is from Kaggle and has over 2.8M rows with 47 columns. In the data, we have 14 numeric columns, 20 categorical columns, and 13 binary columns. These columns also include 3 DateTime columns that are under object datatype. The description of columns after preprocessing is as follows, </p>
		<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
  		<li><b>Index: </b>The index of the row.</li>
  		<li><b>Severity: </b>A number from 1 to 4 that represents the severity of the accident</li>
  		<li><b>Start_Lat: </b>The latitude of the starting point of the accident.</li>
		<li><b>Start_Lng: </b>The longitude of the starting point of the accident. </li>
		<li><b>End_Lat: </b>The latitude of the ending point of the accident.  </li>
		<li><b>End_Lng: </b>The longitude of the ending point of the accident.  </li>
		<li><b>Distance(mi): </b>The distance of the accident from the starting point.  </li>
		<li><b>Temperature(F): </b>The temperature at the time of the accident.  </li>
		<li><b>Wind_Chill(F): </b>The wind chill at the time of the accident.  </li>
		<li><b>Humidity(%): </b>The humidity at the time of the accident.  </li>
		<li><b>Pressure(in): </b>The pressure at the time of the accident.  </li>
		<li><b>Visibility(mi): </b>The visibility at the time of the accident.  </li>
		<li><b>Wind_Speed(mph): </b>The wind speed at the time of the accident.  </li>
		<li><b>Precipitation(in): </b>The precipitation at the time of the accident.  </li>
		<li><b>Start_Time: </b>The start time of the accident.  </li>
		<li><b>End_Time: </b>The end time of the accident.</li>
		<li><b>Street: </b>The name of the street where the accident occurred. </li>
		<li><b>Side: </b>The side of the street where the accident occurred. </li>
		<li><b>City: </b>The name of the city where the accident occurred. </li>
		<li><b>County: </b>The name of the county where the accident occurred. </li>
		<li><b>State: </b>The name of the state where the accident occurred. </li>
		</ul>
		<p> There are several more columns in this dataset that we felt are not relavent to this analysis and have dropped during preprocessing stage of the analysis. </p>

  		<h2>Preprocessing</h2>
  		<h3>Missing values</h3>
  		<p>Preprocessing of the data includes finding and handling the missing values in the dataset. Below is the list of missing values and their percentages in respective columns before preprocessing,</p>
  		<img src='image5.jpg' style='width: 600px; height: 400px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;'>
  		<p>We can see in the visualization below the percentages of missing values in each of the interested columns. We can handle the missing values by dropping the columns with more than 30% missing values, removing the rows with missing values, or replacing the missing values with mean/mode of the respective column. Here we have decided to drop the columns with a lot of missing values first and then removing the rows next.</p>
  		<img src='image6.jpg' style='width: 800px; height: 450px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;'>
		<h3> Handling missing values </h3>
		<p> From the dataset, we have selected suitable columns for this analysis and have dropped all the binary columns, ‘Number’, ‘Zipcode’, ‘Country’, ‘Civil_Twilight’, ‘Nautical_Twilight’, ‘Astronomical_Twilight’. We have dropped all the rows containing missing values and the dataset is now 2.2M rows, and 26 columns at this point.</p>

  		<h2>Exploratory data analysis</h2>
		<h3>Top locations and conditions</h3>
		<p> All of the accidents in this dataset have occured inside the United States of America. Data contains the state, city, county, street, nearby airport if there is one, and weather condition at the time of accidents. We wanted to answer questions like which of the locations have the highest number accidents and understand which weather conditions could have caused most accidents. We developed visualizations and statistics to answer these questions. We can view the statistics, visualizations, and data distribution for all the conditions using dropdown. <br></p>

		<h3> Distribution by time </h3>
		<p> We want to see the distribution of the accidents by time.

We wanted to develope visualizations to answer these questions and get more information and understand the distribution of data. <br><br></p>

	<p> Our column of interest has been the Severity of an accident. Through this reasearch we wanted to understand how each feature in the dataset is affecting it. In depth, Severity ranges from 1 to 4 and indicates how severe an accident has been. We wanted to see if certain weather conditions, visibility range, or particular locations had any significant impact on the severity of an accident. Using visualization we can understand the distribution of the severity. We can observe that highest number of accident are within severity = 2 and severity = 1 has the least.</p>

	<br>
	<h3> Models and Accuracy scores </h3>
	<p> We have tried out 4 different models with Severity as our target column. We had Start_Lat, Start_Lng, End_Lat, End_Lng, Distance, Temperature, Wind_Chill, Humidity, Pressure, Visibility, Wind_Speed, Precipitation, Start_Time, End_Time, Street, Side, City, County, State, Timezone, Airport_Code, Weather_Timestamp, Wind_Direction, Weather_Condition, and Sunrise_Sunset in our training data. All the models have given more than 90% accuracy score which is really good. With the results from analysis, we will be able to predict the severity of an accident given rest of the conditions with really good accuracy. </p>
